# Intra-Exercise Fueling Strategy Optimization for Endurance Athletes
### The Big Idea
I am aiming to create a Python-based optimization tool for endurance athletes. It will be designed to help athletes maintain optimal hydration and energy levels during exercise. The system will provide personalized recommendations based on various factors, such as the athlete's demographics, exercise intensity, and weather conditions.
##### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
User Profile Creation: Athletes can create user profiles, providing information such as age, weight, gender.

Hydration Plan Generation: The system will generate a personalized hydration plan, considering the user's profile, exercise type, duration, and environmental conditions. This can be the MVP.

Weather Integration: The system can use weather APIs to fetch local weather conditions and adjust hydration recommendations accordingly (e.g., hotter weather requires more fluids).
### Learning Objectives
Developing skills in algorithm design with research and piecing together multiple formulas to achieve goal. Learning Flask to be able to create a survey which stores data information of users. API integration within formulas and possibly translating the MVP into an aesthetically pleasing deliverable format for the user to view rather than just data.
### Implementation Plan
+ Research formulas to return desired information to user.
+ Use formulas to determine necessary input from user.
+ Create Flask survey to allow user input to create profile and securely stores the user's data.
+ Hydration Plan Generation based on algorithm
+ Decide on how to produce the data to the user in a user-friendly way.
### Project Schedule
1. Week 1 - Research and creation of algorithm
2. Week 2 - Complete Flask survey for users and create database for users 
3. Week 3 - Implementation of algorithm and weather API with user survey answers
4. Week 4 - Create the display of the plan for user
### Collaboration Plan
Individual project
### Risks and Limitations
Data breaches of user data, algorithm inaccuracy
### Additional Course Content
How to use historical data to check algorithms.
### Beyond the MVP
Allow user to provide feedback on hydration plan, use this data to tailor the algorithm to fit the needs of each individual athlete.

Integration with Wearable Devices: Integrate the system with wearable devices (e.g., fitness trackers) to automatically log workout data and monitor real-time hydration levels.

Real-time Hydration Tracking: Athletes can record their fluid intake during workouts, and the system will provide real-time feedback on whether they are meeting their hydration goals.

# Intra-Exercise Fueling Strategy Optimization for Endurance Athletes
### The Big Idea:
I am aiming to create a Python-based optimization tool for endurance athletes. It will be designed to help athletes maintain optimal hydration and energy levels during exercise. The system will provide personalized recommendations based on various factors, such as the athlete's demographics, exercise intensity, and weather conditions.

##### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
User Profile Creation: Athletes can create user profiles, providing information such as age, weight, gender.

Hydration Plan Generation: The system will generate a personalized hydration plan, considering the user's profile, exercise type, duration, and environmental conditions. This can be the MVP.

Weather Integration: The system can use weather APIs to fetch local weather conditions and adjust hydration recommendations accordingly (e.g., hotter weather requires more fluids).
